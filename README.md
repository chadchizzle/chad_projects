# chad_projects
Various Software Projects demonstrating my skill sets as a full stack developer
Each project folder will have 2 "directories"
a) "extended_project" - branched/clone code/project from another developer ( could be a zip file -- i.e angular projects etc )
b) "ground_up_project" - app/project build 100% by myself ( could be a zip file -- i.e angular projects etc )

*TOOLS used will be notated in corresponding readme.md within projects


#goal - weekly update/pushes to build up my portfolio. 
Any questions, please feel to email me at: chad@direct-connectix.com
